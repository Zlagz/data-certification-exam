    "P_VALUE": "\nThe pvalue of the median age is above 0.05 so it is not statistically significant at the 95% conf level. \nFor the 90% level, the p value is above 0.1 however the t stat is above 1.65 which is contridactory, so not sure for the 90% level. That may come from the fact we only have 12 rows of data. \nI would still say that the median age is not statistically significant neither at 95% nor at 96%.\n",
